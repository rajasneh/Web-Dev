    <title>Eg of CallBack Hell</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Callback Hell refers to a situation in programming, especially in asynchronous JavaScript, where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and maintain. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, often used for handling asynchronous operations like API calls or reading files</p>
    <p><b>By using Promises or Async/Await, you can avoid callback hell and write more readable and maintainable code</b></p>
